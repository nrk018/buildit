# Google Gemini Integration Setup

## ðŸš€ **Google Gemini Imagen 2 Integration**

The application now uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for advanced image analysis and problem detection. This provides much more detailed and accurate analysis compared to the previous mock system.

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Get Google Gemini API Key**

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### 2. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Google Gemini API Configuration
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. **Restart the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Features Enabled with Gemini**

- **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Provides detailed descriptions of what's seen in the image
- **Solution Recommendations**: Suggests specific solutions with cost estimates and timelines
- **Impact Assessment**: Explains potential consequences if problems aren't addressed
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI confidence levels for each detected problem

### **Problem Categories Detected**
1. **Safety Hazards**: Electrical, fire, structural, chemical risks
2. **Maintenance Issues**: Equipment wear, overdue maintenance, breakdown risks
3. **Operational Inefficiencies**: Workflow bottlenecks, space utilization, process issues
4. **Environmental Concerns**: Compliance violations, waste management, pollution risks
5. **Compliance Issues**: Regulatory violations, safety standards, legal requirements

### **Solution Information Provided**
- **Multiple Solutions**: 2+ solutions per problem with different approaches
- **Cost Estimates**: Realistic cost ranges for implementation
- **Timeline**: Expected time to implement solutions
- **Priority Levels**: High, medium, low priority recommendations
- **Impact Analysis**: What happens if problems aren't addressed

## ðŸ“Š **Example Analysis Output**

### **Image Description**
"Industrial manufacturing facility with conveyor systems, electrical panels, and various equipment. The environment shows signs of wear and potential safety concerns."

### **Detected Problems**
1. **Safety Hazard - Exposed Wiring**
   - Severity: Critical
   - Impact: Risk of electrical shock, fire hazard, OSHA violations
   - Solutions: Install protective conduit ($200-$500, 1-2 days)
   - Urgency: Immediate

2. **Equipment Maintenance Overdue**
   - Severity: High
   - Impact: Equipment failure, production downtime, increased repair costs
   - Solutions: Scheduled maintenance program ($1000-$3000, 2-4 weeks)
   - Urgency: Within week

### **Overall Assessment**
"Multiple areas for improvement identified in safety, maintenance, and operations. Prioritize safety issues first, then implement maintenance and workflow improvements."

## ðŸ”„ **Fallback System**

If the Google Gemini API key is not configured or there's an API error, the system automatically falls back to the enhanced mock analysis with:

- **Realistic Problem Detection**: Based on common industrial issues
- **Detailed Solutions**: Multiple solution options with costs and timelines
- **Professional Analysis**: Comprehensive problem descriptions and recommendations

## ðŸš€ **Usage**

1. **Navigate to Idea Page**: Go to `/idea`
2. **Capture/Upload Image**: Use camera or upload an image
3. **AI Analysis**: Gemini analyzes the image and identifies problems
4. **Review Results**: See detailed problem descriptions and solutions
5. **Select Problems**: Choose which issues to address
6. **Generate Solutions**: Get comprehensive solution recommendations

## ðŸ“ˆ **Benefits of Gemini Integration**
